# robotic-arm-inverse-kinematic-solver
A Python-based robotic arm inverse kinematic solver implementing textbook analytic methods using Denavit–Hartenberg parameters. Includes forward kinematics, closed-form IK for standard manipulators (PPP, RRP, PRP, planar 2R/3R, 6R wrist), URDF generation, and PyBullet simulation visualization.
